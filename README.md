# deedList
One of the biggest obsables to getting help is knowing who to ask. This web application addresses that problem by allowing users to post there needs publically or privately so that either close friends and family or the philanthropists of the world can see their need and do a good deed.

Use of the site can be summed up with the following user stories:

## User Story A:  

**As a** person who has just experienced or is experiencing a life altering event,

**I want to** o make my needs known by posting to a website,

**So that** I can share the site with people who can help.

## User Story B:

**As a** person with time and resources to share, 

**I want to** see what individuals' needs are 

**so that** I can use my resources to help them out.
